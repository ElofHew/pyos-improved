It's best for UXTerm/XTerm, tty, and most common terminal emulator.
in Windows, cmd(not powershell) and ConEmu.
in Android, Termux is the best choice.
I dont know how to run it fine in MacOS X, so find it by yourself, if you have trick please send to me or pull request with this file, i will add it

please check config/conf.json when you trying to use "install.py"
if its empty please run "git restore *" and modify it manually.

Enjoy...
